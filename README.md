<h1>Clocked In</h1>  
This is a productivity app built on SwiftUI that will allow users to add customizable tasks and easily track the time spent on each task. The app will also provide a daily summary to show how much time over the day users spent on different tasks. 

Here's the link to a quick video demo: https://youtube.com/shorts/gUUsfdctBtI?feature=share

<h3>4/24 Status:</h3>
The app has three main pages: to-do page, stopwatch page, and insights page.

The to-do page has a date and time banner, and clicking on the clock icon will lead to a pop-up window for adding new tasks. All the tasks will be displayed on this page. The next steps are to sort the tasks by category or have them as different colors.

The stopwatch functions properly on the page, and is customized with our clock mascot. The tasks from the to-do page will be displayed on below the stopwatch. In the future, users will be able to select a task for the session, which will be reflected in the insights page.
