This is a productivity app that will allow users to add tasks and track how much time they spend on different tasks.

4/24 Status:
The app has three main pages: to-do page, stopwatch page, and insights page.

The to-do page has a date and time banner, and also a to-do list sorted by categories. There is a pop-up window for adding new tasks.

The stopwatch functions properly on the page, and is customized with our clock mascot. Our next step will be to add the tasks from the to-do page onto this page so the user 
can select the task before starting the stopwatch.
